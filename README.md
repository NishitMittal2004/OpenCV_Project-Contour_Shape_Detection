# OpenCV Project - Contour/Shape Detection
---
### This project focuses on utilizing the OpenCV library to detect and analyze shapes of objects by finding their contours. Contours are essentially outlines that encapsulate the form of an object, enabling us to identify various shapes present in an image. Additionally, we aim to determine the number of corner points each shape has and compute its corresponding area.
